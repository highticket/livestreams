I've found Python is a great resource for internal audit teams as it is incredibly powerful and a tool right on your laptop.

It fits both the adhoc part of the work as well as the things you can automate for SOX or continuous monitoring of business controls.

If you think you or your team can benefit from leveraging this or other data analytics tools please contact me at highxticket@gmail.com
